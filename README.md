Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Stephan, a full-stack web developer who loves to create software products from end to end. The process of building modern, customer-oriented web solutions fascinates me. Out of curiosity, I taught myself how to use Figma to create design systems, mockups, and clickable prototypes to validate new products, features, and ideas. With the desire to bring these ideas to life, I started learning to write clean and professional code.
