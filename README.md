Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Stephan, a full-stack web developer who loves to create software products from end to end. The process of building modern, customer-oriented web solutions fascinates me. Out of curiosity, I taught myself how to use Figma to create design systems, mockups, and clickable prototypes to validate new products, features, and ideas.

Current Projects:
- [emotivity](https://www.emotivity.de): Let go of burdensome thoughts with daily journal entries, gain a fresh perspective through objective reflection, and improve your awareness by identifying what is good for you.
- [fich](https://www.fich.app): **Fit**ness **Ch**allenges You decide how to get fit and have some fun with adjustable challenges!
